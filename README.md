# Microservice POC

* Hello, I am developing this project as a Proof of Concept (POC) for a Microservice Architecture. 
* It incorporates key components such as a Load Balancer, Discovery Server, Circuit Breaker, and Rate Limiting. 
* Additionally, it includes JUnit testing, JaCoCo code coverage, Checkstyle for code quality, and Projektor for centralized visualization of test results and coverage metrics.
